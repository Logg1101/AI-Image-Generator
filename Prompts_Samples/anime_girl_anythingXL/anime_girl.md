### 🧠 Notes
This test demonstrates **style fidelity differences** between RealisticVision and Anything XL.  
Where RealisticVision leaned toward semi-realistic tones and lighting, **Anything XL** captured a clean, cel-shaded anime aesthetic with sharp edges, smoother skin rendering, and vivid color grading.  

Performance remained fast under the same optimized configuration, confirming that **Anything XL** is a lightweight, CPU-friendly anime model.
